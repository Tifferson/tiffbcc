<h1>Knowledge Base</h1>

<p class="training">
	Knowledge base will hold information submitted by users that are meant to be shared, such as info about competitors.  Our proposed organization will be "notes" that can have files attached to them.  Anyone can make a new note.  We'll have to list them chronologically and do a search.

Changes made to upgrade from 1.7 to 3x codeigniter:

>Changed all references to controllers and models to have their first letter capitalized.

>Instead of using the classname as a function, the function __construct was used.

>calling parent::parentclassname is replaced by parent::__construct.

>The OC_Controller and OC_Model were moved from application/libraries to application/core, along with all other files in application/libraries.

>helpers from application/helpers were moved to system/helpers.

>EXT deprecated. changed use of EXT to php ( 'something'.EXT -> 'something.php').

>mysql_real_escape_string() is deprecated, changed to mysqli_real_escape_string(). Howerver, mysql_real_escape_string() uses one argument, while mysqli_real_escape_string() uses two, so another value had to be added.
mysql_real_escape_string(connection,escapestring). >>unresolved<<
